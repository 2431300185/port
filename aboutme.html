    <h2>Hello!</h2>
    <div class="text"><strong>I'm Christine Kunishima, a student at Aiea High School. I was born and raised here<br> in Hawai'i. I played volleyball before deciding that I enjoyed the sport but didn't <br> want to play competitively. I have a love for chemistry, reading, writing, and got <br> into programming after a few of my friends took a class and taught me a few <br> things in HTML. In my freshman year, I took an early college class for speech 151 <br> and I had a fun time. I feel like it was extremely helpful and I learned a lot. I <br> had a 4.1 GPA that same year and I strive to continue having excellent grades. I <br> consider myself a pretty hard worker and in my free time I enjoy spending time with <br>family and friends. Check out my portfolio to see my work!</strong></div>
